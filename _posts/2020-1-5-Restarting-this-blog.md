title: Restarting this blog
---

Well its apparently been too long since I tried doing this blogging thing, so I'm looking to get it restarted.  I'll be mostly posting about technology topics like [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com"), [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/), Windows, Tablets, maybe even some drones or automation.  I try to avoid it, but I can't deny that there may be the occasional science post, maybe geek entertainment or gadget, and possibly even a libertarian posts, but those should be kept to a minimum.

Hopefully you find something useful, enjoyable, or at least adding a little something that you didn't have before. In the end, that's really the goal here: learning, sharing, and expanding. Maybe through something amazing, often through stumbling, frequently by breaking. But in the end, it should be fun.

So sit back, grab your favorite bottle of beverage, rub your tired eyes, and enjoy yourself!
