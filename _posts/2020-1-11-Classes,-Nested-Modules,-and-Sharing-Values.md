More to come

As I've been working on a recent Module package, I've been separating out the module into nested module files. The main purpose was to keep the functions and commandlets organized based on their purpose or goals.  Eventually, I'd like to separate them out a bit more into interdependent, child modules similar to the Az module with Azure.
